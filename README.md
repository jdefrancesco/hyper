# Hypercube

Simple tesseract written in raw OpenGL by Sam Askinas while in high school or college.. One of those. Made small
changes to allow it to compile on macOS. To run you will need to install freeglut:
`brew install freeglut`

## TODO:

Fix the horrid code format. I found this C file digging through backups so give me a break; i'll fix it.
